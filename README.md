## Image Encoder
Image Encoder is a program that encodes messages into images without easy detection. The program is written in C++, and currently only has a command-line interface.

### Build Instructions
I have provided a makefile, but the program currently only works on Windows.

Just run `make` and the program should compile

### Supported file formats
Currently the program only supports `.png` files, but I am planning to add more file formats.
